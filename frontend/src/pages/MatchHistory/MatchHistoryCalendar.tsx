 * own start day: the month it was created is the first month it can show, and
 * every day before that start day is disabled. Forward is unbounded, so future
 * months and years stay visible and navigable, with their days disabled until
 * they actually arrive.
 *
 * One click chooses one day, and that day is sent to the API the moment it is
 * chosen.
 *
 * Every day is a plain year/month/day, never an instant, so a day the reader
 * selects is the same day that is sent to the API. Nothing here reads the clock
